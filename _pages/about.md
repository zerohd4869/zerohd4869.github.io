I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of **Prof. Songlin Hu**. 
My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning, with a recent focus on representation learning theory, sentiment analysis, and trustworthy large language models. I achieved first place in four tasks at the SemEval competitions and received the Best System Award at SemEval-2023 in Task 12.

Previously, I completed my master's degree in Software Engineering from National Computer System Engineering Research Institute of China and my bachelor's degree in Physics from Shenzhen University. I have also worked as a NLP researcher at China Electronics and Ping An of China before starting my PhD. 


# Research Interests
- **Representation Learning for NLP**
  - Learning theory & principle, generalization, robustness, transferability.
- **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Sentiment classification, emotion recognition, dimensional emotion analysis.
- **Trustworthy Large Language Models**
  - LLM-generated content moderation, hallucination mitigation.
