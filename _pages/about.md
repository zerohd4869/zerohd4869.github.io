I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of **Prof. Songlin Hu**.
Before my Ph.D., I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Physics from Shenzhen University. I also obtained a Master's degree in Software Engineering at the National Computer System Engineering Research Institute of China, under the supervision of **Prof. Xiaoyong Huai**. I have also worked as an algorithm researcher at China Electronics and Ping An of China.

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning, with a recent focus on representation learning theory, sentiment analysis, and trustworthy large language models. I achieved first prize in four tasks at the SemEval Workshops and received the Best System Award at SemEval-2023.

# Research Interests
- **Representation Learning**
  - Learning theory & principles, generalization, robustness, transferability.
- **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Sentiment classification, emotion recognition, dimensional emotion analysis.
- **Trustworthy Large Language Models**
  - Content moderation, hallucination mitigation.
