I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS), under the supervision of [**Prof. Songlin Hu**](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~husonglin?language=en). I completed my bachelor's degree in Physics from Shenzhen University and my master's degree in Software Engineering from National Computer System Engineering Research Institute of China (a joint program with UCAS). Before starting my Ph.D., I also worked as an algorithm researcher at Ping An and CEC.

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. And my research goal is to enable AI to better understand and generate human language. To achieve this, I am currently focused on developing principled representation learning techniques to enhance the generalization, robustness, efficiency, and trustworthiness of language models.

# üìà Industry Applications
- **Galaxy Generative AI Safety Evaluation Platform**, IIE, CAS, 2023-2025. \
  We developed a comprehensive safety evaluation platform for evaluating LLMs in China. The platform leverages three advanced representation learning techniques, including **Supervised Adversarial Contrastive Learning** (Hu et al., 2023a), **Structured Probabilistic Coding** (Hu et al., 2023b), and **Conditional Information Flow Maximization** (Hu et al., 2024), to achieve highly generalized and effective risk identification in generated content. It has generated over 100 automated risk reports for more than 60 mainstream LLMs in China, with detection performance significantly surpassing that of Google/OpenAI APIs.

- **AI Cloud Interview Platform**, Ping An Life Insurance, 2021-2023.  \
  We developed an AI interview platform for training recruitment and employee. The platform use multi-task learning techniques for efficient model training and inference, enabling better intent understanding and interview evaluation. It has supported over 20 million interviews, totaling 3.4 million hours, and provided annual support for 4.72 million recruitment interviews.
 
- **Intelligent Visit Assistant Tool**, Ping An Life Insurance, 2021-2023.  \
  We developed an AI-assisted visit tool for insurance sales. The tool leveraged the domain-specific pre-training technique **Variational Masked Autoencoder** (Hu et al., 2022) to enhance the language understanding capabilities of general PLMs for financial domain data. It has provided intelligent assistance and visit summaries for over 1 million agents during client interactions, achieving more than 10 million online client contacts annually.
