**Dou Hu** is currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Professor [**Songlin Hu**](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~husonglin?language=en). 
Prior to this, he obtained bachelor and master's degrees from Shenzhen University and National Computer System Engineering Research Institute of China, respectively. 

His current research interests include machine learning and natural language processing, with a particular focus on **general representation learning**, **sentiment analysis**, and **harmful content detection**. 
He has published over 10 papers as the primary author in AI conferences and journals, including 4 CCF-A papers.
Furthermore, he won the first place in 4 tasks at SemEval-2022/2023, and was honored with the Best System Award at SemEval-2023.
Additionally, he actively contributes to the AI community as an Area Chair for NAACL 2024, a Journal Reviewer for EAAI and TCSVT, and a Conference Reviewer for various AI conferences.

If you are interested in his work or seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to contact him at [hudou@iie.ac.cn](mailto:hudou@iie.ac.cn).
